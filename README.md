# GigLink

## Project Overview

GigLink is a web-based platform that connects job posters with skilled individuals and shops in a specific area. Job posters can post part-time jobs, and registered bidders can bid on those jobs. The poster can select a bidder from the available candidates. GigLink aims to create a seamless and efficient way for individuals to find part-time work in their local communities.

## Features

- **Job Posting**: Job posters can create job listings under various categories.
- **Bidding System**: Registered bidders can submit bids on posted jobs.
- **Selection Process**: Job posters can review and select a bidder from the list of applicants.
- **Payment**: No online payment system is involved; payment is made in cash after completing the job.
